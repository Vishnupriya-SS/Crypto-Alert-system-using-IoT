# Crypto-Alert-system-using-IoT
The **Crypto Alert System using IoT** is an Internet of Things (IoT) project designed to monitor the price of Bitcoin and alert users when it exceeds a predefined selling price. It uses an ESP32 microcontroller connected to the internet, fetching real-time Bitcoin prices via the CoinGecko API. The system displays the price on an LCD screen and triggers an alert through a buzzer if the price crosses the set threshold. Additionally, it sends a notification via IFTTT webhooks to notify users on their smartphones, making it an efficient and automated tool for cryptocurrency traders.
